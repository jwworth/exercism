# Exercism

These are my solutions to the code challenges of [Exercism](http://exercism.io).

This repository mirrors my Exercism profile:

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/exercism
$ cd exercism

Each problem has its own test; follow the `README` instructions to execute.

### Usage

I made a script to help me download and run exercises. Install Ruby, then:

```
$ bin/start
```

To submit:

```
$ bin/submit
```
